# Multi-fault-diagnosis-of-PEMFC
In this project, a Data-driven neural network for multi-fault diagnosis and classification for PEM fuel cell systems is established. An empirical methodology of feature engineering is presented to reduce model complexity. In the end, a data-driven model with average 95.48% recall is acquired.
Also a fault diagnosis and classification system containing online and offline neural networks training is conceived.
Python, Tensorflow, Keras and AVL CRUISE are used in this project.
